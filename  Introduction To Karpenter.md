Karpenter is an open-source, flexible, high-performance Kubernetes
Cluster Autoscaler built with AWS. It helps improve your application
availability and cluster efficiency by rapidly launching right-sized
compute resources in response to changing application load. Karpenter
also provides just-in-time compute resources to meet your application's
needs and will soon automatically optimize a cluster's compute resource
footprint to reduce costs and improve performance.

Before Karpenter, Kubernetes users needed to dynamically adjust the
compute capacity of their clusters to support applications using
[[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
groups]{.underline}](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html)
and the [[Kubernetes Cluster
Autoscaler]{.underline}](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler).
Nearly half of Kubernetes customers on AWS report that configuring
cluster auto-scaling using the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler is
challenging and restrictive.

When Karpenter is installed in your cluster, Karpenter observes the
aggregate resource requests of unscheduled pods and makes decisions to
launch new nodes and terminate them to reduce scheduling latencies and
infrastructure costs. Karpenter observes events within the Kubernetes
cluster and sends commands to the underlying cloud provider's compute
service, such as Amazon EC2.

Karpenter is an open-source project licensed under the [[Apache License
2.0]{.underline}](https://github.com/awslabs/karpenter/blob/main/LICENSE).
It is designed to work with any Kubernetes cluster running in any
environment, including all major cloud providers and on-premises
environments. We welcome contributions to build additional cloud
providers or to improve core project functionality. If you find a bug,
have a suggestion, or have something to contribute, please engage with

Below is a comprehensive explanation of Karpenter\'s key features and
functionalities:

1.  **Autoscaling for EKS Clusters:**

> Karpenter streamlines the process of scaling EKS clusters by
> automatically managing the underlying infrastructure. It ensures that
> enough worker nodes (EC2 instances) are available to meet your
> Kubernetes workloads\' demands. This autoscaling capability is crucial
> for handling varying workloads efficiently.

2.  **Optimized Resource Provisioning:**

> Karpenter optimizes the allocation of resources by considering factors
> such as application resource requests, limits, and constraints. This
> ensures that the suitable types and sizes of EC2 instances are
> provisioned based on the requirements of your applications, promoting
> cost-effectiveness.

3.  **Integration with Cluster Autoscaler:**

> Karpenter works seamlessly with the Cluster Autoscaler, another
> component of the Kubernetes ecosystem. The Cluster Autoscaler adjusts
> the size of the EKS node groups based on the pending pods in the
> cluster. Karpenter complements this by handling the provisioning of
> new nodes when needed.

4.  **Customizable Policies:**

> Users can define policies to customize Karpenter\'s behaviour
> according to their specific requirements. These policies may include
> constraints on instance types, regions, or other parameters.
> Customization allows users to align Karpenter with their
> organization\'s preferences and policies.

5.  **Event-Driven Scaling:**

> Karpenter employs an event-driven architecture that responds to
> triggers and events in the EKS cluster. For example, if there are
> pending pods waiting to be scheduled and the existing nodes are
> insufficient, Karpenter will automatically initiate the provisioning
> of additional nodes.

6.  **Support for Spot Instances:**

> Karpenter supports using Spot Instances, which includes spare EC2
> instances available at a lower cost. By integrating with Spot
> Instances, Karpenter helps optimize infrastructure costs for EKS
> clusters, making it an attractive option for cost-conscious users.

7.  **Easy Installation and Management:**

> Setting up Karpenter for an EKS cluster is designed to be
> straightforward. AWS provides documentation and resources to guide
> users through the installation and configuration process. Once set up,
> Karpenter operates autonomously, reducing the operational burden on
> users.

8.  **Community and Open Source:**

> Karpenter is part of the open-source community and is actively
> developed and maintained. The community-driven nature of the project
> encourages collaboration and contributions from users, ensuring
> ongoing improvements and updates.

**Installation of Karpenter for production use**

To install Karpenter for production use, you typically follow the steps
to configure and deploy it in your Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes
Service) cluster on AWS. Be informed that the exact steps may vary based
on updates and changes, so it\'s recommended to refer to the official
AWS documentation for the most current information.

Here is a comprehensive guide on the installation of Karpenter:

**Prerequisites:**

-   **Amazon EKS Cluster:**

Ensure that you have an Amazon EKS cluster set up and running. You
should have the necessary AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) configured
with the appropriate credentials.

-   **kubectl:**

Install and configure kubectl to interact with your EKS cluster. This
tool is used to manage Kubernetes clusters.

-   **AWS CLI:**

Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed, as it\'s required for
authentication and interaction with AWS services.

**Steps for Karpenter Installation:**

1.  **Install Helm:**

> Karpenter is often installed using Helm, a package manager for
> Kubernetes applications. Install Helm on your local machine by
> following the instructions in the Helm documentation.
>
> Add Karpenter Helm Repository:
>
> Add the Karpenter Helm repository to your Helm configuration.
>
> helm repo add aws https://aws.github.io/eks-charts
>
> helm repo update
>
> Install Karpenter:
>
> Use Helm to install Karpenter on your EKS cluster.
>
> bash
>
> Copy code
>
> helm upgrade -i karpenter aws/karpenter -n kube-system \--set
> clusterName=\<your-cluster-name\>

Replace \<your-cluster-name\> with the name of your EKS cluster.

**2. Verify Installation:**

Confirm that Karpenter is running as expected.

> kubectl get pods -n kube-system \| grep karpenter
>
> This should display Karpenter pods in the kube-system namespace.

3.  **Configuration (Optional):**

> Karpenter provides various configuration options that you can
> customize based on your requirements. These configurations are
> specified in the Helm chart during installation. Refer to the official
> Karpenter documentation for a detailed list of configuration options.

4.  **Monitoring and Troubleshooting:**

> Monitor Karpenter\'s logs for any issues or errors. You can check the
> logs using:
>
> kubectl logs -n kube-system deployment/carpenter

5.  **Updating Karpenter:**

To update Karpenter to a new version, you can use Helm to upgrade the
installation:

Helm upgrade karpenter aws/karpenter -n kube-system \--set
clusterName=\<your-cluster-name\>
